Assignment 1 Reflection

  I’m not going to lie, this assignment was a bit of a challenge, mostly because I was looking up and learning about a lot of 
the stuff I was using as I went. I ended up having to invest extra time into the project, and even then I wasn’t quite able to 
finish. The edit page part isn’t fully complete. It shows the raw data in a textarea box, but submitting any changes doesn’t do
anything. Also there’s this weird bug where it doesn’t work for the login page, for some reason.
	Challenges aside, I did really enjoy working on it. Sure, there were moments of frustration, but I was also excited when I 
finally figured out how certain things connected. (Like how html and templates came into play.) Plus it was just generally 
cool to be able to make something as practical as a webpage, even if it was just a basic one. The whole experience was made 
even better by the occasional help I got from classmates when I was stuck. I definitely wouldn’t have gotten as far as I did 
without them. 
	So yeah. If I could do things differently, I’d probably want to learn more about scripting first before diving into making a 
web app, like a lot of people suggested. I can’t deny that this was a good learning experience, though, and overall I’m okay 
with how things turned out.
